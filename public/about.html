          <p>  
            Acclaimed for his warm, captive and honest stage presence, Michael Hoffman, a native of Minnesota, is an avid performer and interpreter of art song, oratorio, opera, and choral music, and is currently pursuing a Master of Music degree at the University of Colorado at Boulder. 
          </p>
          <p> 
            While working on his Bachelor of Music degree at the University of Minnesota, Hoffman was exposed to the beauty and intimacy of German Lieder, and this sparked a passion which lead him to the Franz Schubert Institut in 2013 and 2014. This summer, he will attend Songfest as a member of the Professional Program where he will further his knowledge of song and performance practices with some of the world’s leading performers and pedagogues of the vocal repertoire.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to numerous song recitals, Michael’s recent career highlights include singing Jacey Squires in Willson's <i>The Music Man</i> (2015), and Spoletta in Puccini's <i>Tosca</i> (2015) with the Colorado Symphony; Ferrando in Mozart's <i>Cosi fan Tutte</i> (2015), and Martin in Copland's <i>The Tender Land</i> (2016) with CU’s Eklund Opera; and appearing as the tenor soloist for the Boulder Philharmonic’s performance of Handel’s <i>Messiah</i> (2015), and as tenor soloist with the Oratory Bach Ensemble, Minneapolis (2014, 2015, 2016).  In the fall of 2016, he will appear as Alfred in the Eklund Opera’s production of <i>Die Fledermaus</i>.
          </p>
          <p>  
            Outside the concert hall, Michael loves spending time in the outdoors, woodworking, and working with dogs. While still in Minnesota, Michael maintained a studio of fifteen vocal students of all ages, and has continued his love of teaching in Colorado as the music teacher for Avid for Adventure, a summertime day academy for children.  
            </p>
          <p>
            Through his career, Michael hopes to revolutionize the vocal recital by making the intimacy, depth, and emotional honesty of art song accessible to all audiences.
